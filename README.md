# 3D-Raytracing
Recursive ray tracing algorithm that implements ambient illumination, diffuse illumination, specular reflection and shadows on 3D objects.
After users input different number and size of spheres or polygons, and position the location of the light source. The program will render the image of these 3D objects with reflection and refraction, scattering, and dispersion effects.
